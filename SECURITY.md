**Subject**: [SECURITY] Vulnerability Report
**Response Time**: 24 hours maximum

### What to Include
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested mitigation (if any)

### What NOT to Do
- ‚ùå Publicly disclose before we've had time to fix
- ‚ùå Access real customer data (Mona la Dona, etc.)
- ‚ùå Perform destructive testing
- ‚ùå Social engineering attacks

## üõ°Ô∏è Threat Model

### Protected Assets
1. **Customer Business Data**
   - Mona la Dona's product catalog and orders
   - Sano Market's inventory and pricing
   - La Papeler√≠a's customer information

2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - User credentials and sessions
   - Multi-tenant data isolation
   - API access tokens

3. **Business Intelligence**
   - Sales analytics and trends
   - Customer behavior patterns
   - Pricing algorithms

4. **Infrastructure**
   - Database credentials
   - API keys (OpenAI, payment processors)
   - Kubernetes cluster access

### Threat Actors

#### External Attackers
- **Motivation**: Financial gain, data theft
- **Capabilities**: Automated scanning, credential stuffing
- **Attack Vectors**: Web application, API endpoints

#### Malicious Insiders
